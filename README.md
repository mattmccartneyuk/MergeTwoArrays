# MergeTwoArrays
Given two arrays of integers, merge both together in a single sequential array.
## Details

- Uses a dictionary in order to track the occurrences of items in two arrays, each key represents the number being tracked while the value represents the number of occurrences of the key across the two arrays.
- The occurrences dictionary is merged using a For Loop which extends the return array.

This project is <strong>NOT</strong> intended for production. It is a simple experimental project to demonstrate using a dictionary to merge two arrays sequentially.
